## LIBFT

The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during the C Piscine. 
The goal is building your very own code library, like `stdlib.h`, with all kinds of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects. 
This will save you a lot of precious time and effort.

The following assignments will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the Piscine.
See the libft project as a refresher for what you learned in the piscine and use it wisely to assess your level and progress
